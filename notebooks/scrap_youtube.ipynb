      "[00:04:07] I run this with formatting it's going to\n",
      "[00:04:09] look slightly differently so you see we\n",

      "[00:04:14] the level and there is a space between\n",

      "[00:04:19] formatting is really helpful really easy\n",
      "[00:04:21] to change and then you change it again\n",
      "[00:04:24] in one place and then it's applied\n",

      "[00:04:31] write a to file and you can simply do\n",

      "[00:07:49] trail basically stores the logs for you\n",
      "[00:07:52] keeps them available for a number of\n",

      "[00:09:21] really dangerous so how do you address\n",
      "[00:09:23] this well one is that you always need to\n",
